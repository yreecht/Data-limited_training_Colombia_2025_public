## Life history "invariants" / theory

.pull-left[
Reminder from last lecture:

* Life history shapes the size composition of a population.

* There are combinations of life history traits (LHT) which are more likely than others.

    * they tend to co-vary with life history strategies (! some of them define these strategies)

    * species from a same group are more likely to share some life history.

    * ...but there may be strong variations within a same taxonomic group

    * [**new**]: there may be large variations within a same species*****!

  individuals of a same (ectotherm) species tending to have larger asymptotic sizes ($L_{\infty}$)
  and maturation size when they inhabit colder environments.]

  => Beyond the obvious estimation uncertainty, **do not trust blindly any LHT found for the same species**!

## Population at equilibrium

.pull-left[At equilibrium (constant recruitment and mortality), 

  * the size composition of the population is mainly shaped by $M/k$ and scaled by $L_{\infty}$.

  * the length at maturity (as a proportion of $L_{\infty}$), will determine how cramped against the
    largest sizes the fraction mature will be.

## Population at equilibrium

At equilibrium (constant recruitment and mortality), with fishing, 

  * Selectivity is often considered sigmoidal (i.e. logistic curve)...

  * ...other (non-asymptotic) selectivities could be theoretically used to estimate the equilibrium.

  * the fishing mortality will operate size-selective removal (additional mortality), and, if
    constant, the size composition will tend towards a new equilibrium...
    
    $M/k$ becomes $(M+F)/k$ over $L_c$.

  * If the population is observed from fisheries data, selectivity also affect which fraction of the
population is actually observed (left-truncation)

### Spawning potential ratio (SPR)

> The spawning potential ratio (SPR) of a stock is defined as the proportion of the unfished reproductive potential left at any given level of fishing pressure. 
[(Hordyk *et al.*, 2015b)](http://icesjms.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/doi/10.1093/icesjms/fsu004)

--

  * largest individuals usually have a larger reproduction potential in fish (fecundity $\propto$
    weight).
    
    *  **=> importance of the weight-length relationships parameters *a* and *b***: $W = aL^b$.

    * Egg production depends on the maturity ogive too: $E \propto Mat_l \times W_l$

--

  * Intuitively: largest individuals have the largest reproductive potential $\times$ selective
    removal of the largest  
    => reduction of reproductive potential.

.pull-right[Abundante literature about what is a safe SPR:

* Recommended $SPR > 0.4$. But a target at $SPR \in [0.35,0.4]$ is also widely accepted for most life histories.
* $SPR \le 0.2$ is considered unsafe (impaired recruitment).
* But of course depends on the SRR!
]

## The LB-SPR model

A model which implement all that, and more*, to calculate a theoretical size composition given a set
of life history traits/"invariants".

Reparametrisation of the logistic curves (fishing selectivity, maturity) for using $L_{50\%}$ and
$L_{95\%}$ (easier to estimate from data, widely available, etc.)

$$S_l = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-ln(19)(l - L_{S50}) / (L_{S95} - L_{S50})}}$$

--

.pull-left[Two important assumptions ensue:

* **=> Fishing selectivity is assumed assymptotic**

* Assumes F applied with the same selectivity as the one supporting the observations.]

  * compared to sometimes more simplistic size composition models,  
  it includes the effect of
    inter-individual growth variability (instrumental in  
    shaping the right-end of the size
    composition, particularly for low $M/k$).
  * incorporate growth-type-groups to account for differential mortality among individuals with
    different growth (aka "Lee's Phenomenon").
  * implement the possibility of having a size-varying natural mortality ($M/k$ is then defined at
    $L_{\infty}$).

## Estimation from empirical size composition

If you have observed size data, **representative** of the size composition of the underlying
population &ndash; assuming that the model assumptions are met and given user-provided life history
traits &ndash; LBSPR can estimate:

 * the most likely SPR,
 * the corresponding F/M.
 * the selectivity ogive (L<sub>S50</sub>, L<sub>S95</sub>) of the fishery/survey, depending on the
   data origin.

...and their confidence intervals.

theorethical size composition (given user-provided parameters) fits best the empirical data.]]

.pull-left[# Use for management

**A lots of advantages:**

Rely on data that are (relatively) cheap and easy to collect.  
Designed to work best with fisheries-dependent data (size composition equilibrium integrates removal
with selectivity estimated from the data)... observer/self-sampling vs. commisioning a survey
vessel!

Considered quite robust. One of the few models to account for different mortality rates among
individuals of the same age-group growing at different paces ("Lee's phenomeon").

Possibility to estimate (MSY proxy) reference points... if the steepness of the SRR is known.  
(spoiler alerte: it rarely is!)

Simulation tool: quite handy for some applications.

## Conditions for applicability

 <br />

Model assumptions will never be fully met, but "close enough" is essential.

 <br />

.full-width[.content-box-yellow[**An important aspect of the expertise resides in evaluating what is
"close enough"!**]]

---

Most important assumptions:

 * **The size distribution is representative** of the population (on the right side). <br /> Quite
   difficult to evaluate, but really essential. <br /> This will often come down to the questions:
   * Is the sampled fraction representative of the whole population?
   * Is the sampling design properly accounted for while raising the size composition? (_E.g._
     stratification if spatial heterogeneity, raising to catch in primary sampling unit, etc.)
   * **Is the gear selectivity asymptotic?** <br /> Although it could theoretically work with
     different patterns, LBSPR assumes an asymptotic selectivity curve.

---

Most important assumptions:

 * **The population is at equilibrium**. <br /> A number of situations may raise concern about this:
   * Recent<sup>1</sup> .footnote[<sup>1</sup>This has to be evaluated in relation to the longevity
     and generation time of the species.] settlement; the population did not have time to reach
     equilibrium.
   * Strong and frequent<sup>1</sup> variations in the exploitation level and or pattern: no time
     for reaching different equilibrium between change.
   * Strong variations (pulses) and/or trends (_e.g._ regime shift, strong auto-correlation in time)
     in the recruitment may also prevent equilibrium.


---

.pull-left[
Most important assumptions:

 * **Relevant life history "invariants"** <br /> LB-SPR is sensitive to parameter misspecifications,
   in particular:

    * $L_{\infty}$: scales everything! <br /> <span style="color:darkred;">Beware of the
      temperature-size rule!!</span>
    * $M/k$: one of the primary parameters controling the shape at equilibrium...

## Empirical evidence / success

Empirical evidence is quite difficult to gather, as evaluating management strategies in the real world takes a long time, but:

--

* growing portfolio of documented success stories (*e.g.* Prince *et al.*, 2020), despite the relatively young
  age of the model implementation (~10 years).

* based on strong theoretical fundations.
  
  (I hope I managed to convinced you of that one!)

* tested and validated using MSE (refs.)

=> widely used, and endorsed by scientifc organisations such as ICES.

## Known limitations

It also has a few flaws:

* reliance on the equilibrium assumption is strong.

* only implemented for an asymptotic, mono-modal fisheries selectivity, while dome-shaped
  selectivity is not-uncommon.

* sensitivity to input parameters, some of which are quite uncertain in most cases (refs.)... that
  is true of so many assessment methods, including data rich, though!

* as of now, not able to impose some correlation on estimates among years (*e.g.* selectivity, if
  one knows that practices/fishing patterns are not changing much among years).

* may "spit" seemingly consistent results, however poor one's choice of data and LHT is.
